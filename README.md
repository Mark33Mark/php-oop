### 1. Description
**What is this project?**
* An exploration into Object Oriented Programming in PHP.

**Why this project?**
* It was an exercise set in the online tutorial provided by [Programming With Gio](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgramWithGio).

**What problem does this project solve?**
* Provides a basis for uploading a file and using the server side to save the data in the file for later processing / retrieval.

**Lessons learnt?**
* PHP is a great programming language, however, like a lot of programming languages, there are a lot of ways to achieve the same outcome, but often there is only the 1 way to do it efficiently.

### 2. User Story

```
AS A company executive
I WANT quickly create transaction reports summarising my account activities
SO THAT I can provide the team with a one point access to review the transaction data.
```
---
### 3. Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a landing page with an upload file button
WHEN I select the upload button
THEN I am presented with a file manager dialogue window to navigate and select the file I want to upload
WHEN I finish selecting the file if the file is not .csv file and less than 2Mb
THEN I receive a notification / toast that the request has failed
WHEN I attempt again to select a .csv file less than 2Mb
THEN I am presented with a notification / toast that the file upload was successful
WHEN I select the `Report` button 
THEN I am taken to a new page and provided with a report of all the data I uploaded, including summations of the data.  There is also a persisting notification that there is new data.
WHEN I leave the page and come back at another stage, with out uploading a further report but just selecting `Report`
THEN I am provided again the report with all the data previously uploaded and without the notifcation message at the top of the report that there is new data.
```
---
### 4. Features
- users select .csv files to upload which are then processed with the data saved into a database.
- the app architecture loosely follows the M-V-C structure.
- you can add as many .csv files as needed, when ready, selecting the `Report` button will run the script to save the data to the database and generate the report.
- handy UI notifications / toasts are provided to help users know if their requests have been fulfilled.  A simple timer has been added to the notifications / toasts so that they clear in notification / toast time set.
- there is a file checker to make sure users are only uploading compliant .csv files less than the system's file size restrictions.

### 5. Installation
1. Download / clone the source code from my repository located in: [GitHub](https://github.com/Mark33Mark/php-oop) 
2. If using Docker, which I recommend to test this project initially, then `cd` into the docker directory & run `docker-compose up -d`. 
3. If you are already have a server environment setup and are using something else like XAMPP, make sure you have Web Server (Apache), PHP & MySQL running.
4. **PHP 8** is required for this source code to not error out your console üòñ.  If you like hanging onto the past then you will need to adjust the code to make it work for lower PHP versions.
5. Create a `.env` file by copying variables from `.env.example`. Fill in those values in your `.env` file.
6. Make sure that whatever database name you enter actually exists, if not, create that database.
7. I recommend using `mySQL Workbench`, from in Workbench or the mySQL CLI, run this Prepared Statement script - I considered adding this into the code, however it is only needed once to set up the database so decided not to:
```
USE put-your-database-name-here;  
CREATE TABLE transactions (  
id INT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  
transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,  
check_number MEDIUMINT,  
description VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  
amount DECIMAL(6,2)  
);  
```
8. Confirm that once you open your `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever local port you've configured) that it loads the home page.
9. Sample transaction files are provided in the required format for you to test uploading: [file 1](docs/transactions_sample1.csv) and [file 2](docs/transactions_sample2.csv)

### 6. Usage
The code is available from: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mark33Mark/https://github.com/Mark33Mark/php-oop) and includes all assets required for the project.  
Once you've downloaded, you can modify the code as you need.

### 7. Credits
This project was done as part of a YouTube PHP tutorial I discovered. It is: [Program With Gio](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgramWithGio)
Amazing tutorials - really well set out and providing logical progression to help those of us wanting to improve their PHP knowledge.  
Course outline available on [Gio's GitHub](https://github.com/ggelashvili/learnphptherightway-outline) 
Nice work Gio, thanks for all the hard work you've done to create these useful tutorials üëçüèº
